# inst414-final-project-Ajuani-Hall
Part 2 of the Final Project for INST 414
Project Overview

In the banking and finance sector, fraud detection and prevention is a critical business problem due to substantial risks of financial losses, reputational damage, and erosion of customer trust. This project aims to develop an advanced fraud detection system using machine learning techniques to accurately identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time, thereby safeguarding the institution's assets and maintaining customer trust.
